I am a fanatical bike rider and enjoy exploring the city this way.\n\nI have several listings on airbnb, most in Athens but also in other parts of Greece like islands and mainland suited to all needs. After all what is greater than to start your holidays with a few days in Athens, the cradle of modern society, and afterwards relax on one of our beautiful islands near the beach or in nature.\n\nOpen and clear communication are very important to me.
